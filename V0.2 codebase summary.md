# CompanyOS v0.2 Codebase Summary

This document summarizes the state of the CompanyOS codebase as of v0.2, based on planning documents and source code analysis.

## Purpose

CompanyOS is an AI-native operating system designed to assist founders/solopreneurs by using LLM-powered agents to analyze daily context, provide insights, and generate prioritized directives. It aims to provide "cognitive leverage" by automating parts of the CEO's daily reflection and prioritization process.

## Core Features (Implemented as of v0.2)

1.  **Daily Context Input (`Pulse`):**
    *   **Implementation:** A CLI script (`src/pulse/runPulse.ts`).
    *   **Functionality:** Prompts the user daily for their goal, blockers, energy level, feedback, etc.
    *   **Output:** Saves context as structured JSON (`context/YYYY-MM-DD.json`) and updates `context/latest.json`.

2.  **Agent Execution (`Orchestrator`):**
    *   **Implementation:** Main script (`src/orchestrator/runAllAgents.ts`).
    *   **Functionality:** Reads the latest pulse context, loads historical context (last N days), loads static company documents (`company/summary.md`), runs a suite of agents sequentially, collects feedback, and handles output generation.

3.  **Specialized Agents:**
    *   **Location:** `src/agents/`
    *   **Implemented Agents:**
        *   `strategyAgent`: Focuses on priorities and tradeoffs.
        *   `productAgent`: Focuses on UX and feature clarity.
        *   `engineeringAgent`: Focuses on technical debt, performance, and blockers.
        *   `marketingAgent`: Focuses on messaging and positioning.
        *   `ethicsAgent`: Focuses on alignment with values and risks.
        *   `wellnessAgent`: Focuses on user energy and burnout risk.
    *   **Mechanism:** Each agent uses an LLM (via `src/utils/llm.ts`) and specific prompts (`prompts/*.txt`) to analyze inputs and generate structured JSON responses.

4.  **Synthesis (`Chief of Staff`):**
    *   **Implementation:** Dedicated agent (`src/agents/chiefOfStaffAgent.ts`).
    *   **Functionality:** Synthesizes outputs from all other agents into a clear daily directive (Do, Delay, Ignore, Delegate), considering current context, historical pulses, and memory.

5.  **Output:**
    *   **Console:** The orchestrator prints the formatted Chief of Staff's summary to the console upon completion.
    *   **Files:** Saves detailed agent responses, user feedback, and the CoS summary to timestamped JSON (`outputs/YYYY-MM-DD.json`) and Markdown (`outputs/YYYY-MM-DD.summary.md`) files.

6.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   **Implementation:** Integrated into the orchestrator (`src/orchestrator/runAllAgents.ts`).
    *   **Functionality:** Optionally prompts the user (via CLI) to rate each agent's output (1-5) and provide text notes.
    *   **Output:** Feedback is saved within the daily output JSON under `creative_director_input.agent_feedback`.

7.  **Memory:**
    *   **Implementation:** Simple JSON-based memory system (`memory/company-memo.json`).
    *   **Functionality:** Stores key information (potentially weekly summaries) intended to provide longer-term context, primarily used by the Chief of Staff agent.

8.  **Static Context:**
    *   **Implementation:** Markdown files in `governance/`, `constitution/`, and `company/`.
    *   **Functionality:** Provides overarching guidance (`governance.md`, `constitution.md`) and company-specific details (`company/summary.md`) used as context by agents.

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Runtime:** Node.js
*   **LLM Integration:** OpenAI API (via `openai` npm package)
*   **Environment Management:** `dotenv`
*   **Build System:** `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler)
*   **Package Manager:** npm

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized with clear separation of concerns:

*   `src/`: TypeScript source code
    *   `agents/`: Individual agent logic
    *   `orchestrator/`: Main script to run agents
    *   `pulse/`: Script to capture daily input
    *   `utils/`: Shared utilities (LLM caller)
    *   `types.ts`: Core TypeScript type definitions
*   `prompts/`: Text files containing prompts for each agent
*   `context/`: Stores daily pulse data (`YYYY-MM-DD.json`, `latest.json`)
*   `outputs/`: Stores the JSON and Markdown output from orchestrator runs
*   `memory/`: Stores persistent memory files (`company-memo.json`)
*   `company/`: Holds static documents about the company (summary, legal, etc.)
*   `governance/`: Governance rules document
*   `constitution/`: Core principles document
*   `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript output
*   `node_modules/`: Project dependencies
*   Configuration files: `.env`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`

## How to Run

1.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
2.  Configure `.env` with `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3.  Run daily pulse: `npm run start:pulse`
4.  Run orchestrator: `npm run start:orchestrator`
5.  Review outputs in the `outputs/` directory and the console.

## State Summary

CompanyOS v0.2 is a functional CLI application that orchestrates multiple LLM-based agents to provide synthesized daily guidance based on user input and predefined context. It successfully implements the core features outlined in the v0.1 and v0.2 planning documents, establishing a foundation for an "agentic operating system".
