# CompanyOS v0.2.5 Codebase Summary

This document summarizes the state of the CompanyOS codebase as of v0.2.5, updating the v0.2 summary based on implemented changes.

## Purpose

CompanyOS is an AI-native operating system designed to assist founders/solopreneurs by using LLM-powered agents to analyze daily context, provide insights, and generate prioritized directives. It aims to provide "cognitive leverage" by automating parts of the CEO's daily reflection and prioritization process.

## Core Features (Implemented as of v0.2.5)

1.  **Daily Context Input (`Pulse`):**
    *   **Implementation:** `src/pulse/runPulse.ts`.
    *   **Functionality:** Prompts the user daily for structured context (goal, blockers, energy, etc.).
    *   **Output:** Saves context as structured JSON (`context/YYYY-MM-DD.json`, `context/latest.json`).
    *   **(No changes from v0.2)**

2.  **Agent Execution (`Orchestrator`):**
    *   **Implementation:** Main script (`src/orchestrator/runAllAgents.ts`).
    *   **Functionality:** 
        *   Loads latest pulse, historical pulses, company docs, and company memo.
        *   Loads agent configuration (`config/agents.json`).
        *   Runs **enabled** agents sequentially in an **interactive one-on-one loop** using `inquirer`.
        *   Presents each agent's initial brief.
        *   Prompts user for action (`Include these ideas, next agent`, `Respond`, `Don't include, skip agent`).
        *   If user responds, captures response, triggers agent's reply function, and displays the reply.
        *   Collects detailed `interactionHistory` for each agent (brief, response, reply, skipped status).
        *   Conditionally runs Chief of Staff agent based on config.
        *   Handles output saving.

3.  **Specialized Agents:**
    *   **Location:** `src/agents/`
    *   **Implemented Agents:** Strategy, Product, Engineering, Marketing, Ethics, Wellness.
    *   **Structure:** Refactored agent logic into two primary functions:
        *   `get<AgentName>Brief`: Generates the initial conversational brief (string).
        *   `get<AgentName>Reply`: Generates a conversational reply (string) based on user input.
    *   **Mechanism:** Each agent uses an LLM (via `src/utils/llm.ts`) and specific brief/reply prompts (`prompts/*BriefPrompt.txt`, `prompts/*ReplyPrompt.txt`) to analyze inputs and generate conversational string responses.
    *   **Parsing:** Includes enhanced parsing logic (`parseLLMStringResponse`) to handle potential JSON from LLM and format it into a readable string for the user.

4.  **Synthesis (`Chief of Staff`):**
    *   **Implementation:** Dedicated agent (`src/agents/chiefOfStaffAgent.ts`).
    *   **Functionality:** 
        *   Receives Pulse, history, docs, memo, and the detailed `interactionHistory` from the orchestrator.
        *   Synthesizes all inputs, considering skipped agents and user responses/replies, into a final daily directive (Do, Delay, Ignore, Delegate) with rationale.
    *   **Execution:** Run conditionally based on `config/agents.json`.

5.  **Output:**
    *   **Console:** Orchestrator prints agent briefs/replies interactively. Prints the final Chief of Staff summary if CoS is enabled.
    *   **Files:** 
        *   Saves detailed run output to timestamped JSON (`outputs/YYYY-MM-DD.json`), now including `config_used` and the full `interactionHistory` array.
        *   Saves the CoS summary to Markdown (`outputs/YYYY-MM-DD.summary.md`), if CoS is enabled and produces output.

6.  **Agent Configuration:**
    *   **Implementation:** JSON file (`config/agents.json`).
    *   **Functionality:** Allows enabling/disabling individual agents (including ChiefOfStaff) for each run.
    *   **Orchestrator:** Reads this file at startup to determine which agents to include in the interactive loop and whether to run the final synthesis.

7.  **Memory (`company-memo.json`):**
    *   **(No change from v0.2)** Still loaded and passed to agents (including CoS) for longer-term context.

8.  **Static Context (Markdown files):**
    *   **(No change from v0.2)** Still loaded and passed to agents.

9.  **Feedback Loop (v0.2):**
    *   **(Removed)** The explicit rating/notes feedback loop from v0.2 has been removed, replaced by the interactive respond/reply mechanism within the agent one-on-ones.

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Runtime:** Node.js
*   **LLM Integration:** OpenAI API (via `openai` npm package)
*   **CLI Interaction:** `inquirer` (New dependency)
*   **Environment Management:** `dotenv`
*   **Build System:** `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler)
*   **Package Manager:** npm
*   **(Note:** `readline` no longer used by orchestrator).

## Project Structure

The codebase organization is largely similar to v0.2, with additions:

*   `src/`: TypeScript source code
    *   `agents/`: Individual agent logic (refactored into brief/reply functions).
    *   `orchestrator/`: Main script (updated for interactive loop, config loading).
    *   `pulse/`: (Unchanged).
    *   `utils/`: (Unchanged).
    *   `types.ts`: Core types (updated with `AgentInteraction`, `ChiefOfStaffInput`, etc.).
*   `prompts/`: Text prompts (renamed `*Prompt.txt` -> `*BriefPrompt.txt`, added `*ReplyPrompt.txt`).
*   `context/`: (Unchanged).
*   `outputs/`: Stores run output (JSON format updated, MD conditional).
*   `memory/`: (Unchanged).
*   `company/`, `governance/`, `constitution/`: (Unchanged).
*   `config/`: **New directory** containing `agents.json`.
*   `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript output.
*   `node_modules/`: Project dependencies.
*   Configuration files: `.env`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`.

## How to Run

1.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
2.  Configure `.env` with `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3.  **(Optional)** Configure agent participation in `config/agents.json`.
4.  Run daily pulse: `npm run start:pulse`
5.  Run orchestrator: `npm run start:orchestrator`
6.  Interact with agents via console prompts.
7.  Review outputs in the `outputs/` directory and the console.

## State Summary

CompanyOS v0.2.5 transforms the agent execution model from sequential processing to an interactive, conversational loop. Users engage in one-on-one dialogues with enabled agents before receiving a final synthesized directive from the Chief of Staff. Agent participation is now configurable. This version aligns with the v0.2.5 PRD, focusing on the user experience of interacting with a team of specialized agents.
