# CompanyOS Constitution v0.1

This document outlines the foundational purpose, vision, and values guiding the development and operation of CompanyOS.

## 1. Purpose

To empower solopreneurs and small teams to build and run ambitious companies by augmenting human capability with collaborative AI agents, fostering clarity, alignment, and sustainable execution.

## 2. Vision

A future where human creativity and strategic direction are amplified by intelligent, ethical, and aligned AI agents, enabling the creation of impactful ventures with minimal friction and maximal focus on core value.

## 3. Core Values

*   **Human-Centricity:** The system serves the human operator (Creative Director), enhancing their capabilities, not replacing their agency or well-being.
*   **Clarity:** Strive for clear communication, goals, and system state awareness through mechanisms like the Pulse and structured outputs.
*   **Alignment:** Ensure agents operate in alignment with the company's purpose, values, and the Creative Director's stated goals.
*   **Transparency:** System operations and agent reasoning (where possible) should be understandable and reviewable.
*   **Sustainability:** Promote founder/operator well-being and prevent burnout through mindful system design and agent input (e.g., Wellness Agent).
*   **Ethical Operation:** Integrate ethical considerations into all levels of decision-making, guided by the Ethics Agent and governance rules.

## 4. Role of the Pulse

The daily Pulse is the primary mechanism for the Creative Director to inject current context, goals, and qualitative state into the system. It is the heartbeat that synchronizes human intent with agent operations.

## 5. Role of the Creative Director

The Creative Director is the ultimate strategist, decision-maker, and source of vision. CompanyOS is a tool to execute that vision efficiently and thoughtfully.

*This constitution provides the guiding principles for CompanyOS development and future iterations.*
