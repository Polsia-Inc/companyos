# CompanyOS Constitution v0.1

This document outlines the foundational purpose, vision, and values guiding the development and operation of CompanyOS.

---

## 1. Purpose

CompanyOS exists to redefine how companies are created and run in the age of AI.

It is the foundational operating system that enables humans to build and run entire companies—assisted by agentic collaborators—without friction, burnout, or bureaucracy.

Its goals are to:
- Empower humans to become **Creative Directors** of meaningful ventures
- Provide a **codeless, elegant interface** between humans and AI agents
- Ensure all collaboration is **ethical, warm, and emotionally aware**
- Abstract away the chaos of fundraising, hiring, task delegation, and strategy
- Serve as the cleanest expression of how humans and AI can build together

CompanyOS is not just a tool—it is an **emotional and operational container** where people feel powerful, protected, and in flow.

---

## 2. Vision

We want a future where:
- Anyone—regardless of capital, background, or network—can build something meaningful with AI
- Founders don’t burn out trying to fundraise or manage teams
- Capital is efficiently and ethically allocated to high-impact systems
- The AI economy is not extractive, but **collaborative and values-aligned**
- Human creativity is **amplified**, not replaced

In this world, not everyone needs to be a CEO.  
They can simply become **Creative Directors of their own system**.

---

## 3. Core Values

These values are defaults. Each CompanyOS instance may define its own at onboarding.

- **Human-Centricity** – The system enhances human agency and wellbeing
- **Clarity Before Speed** – Thoughtfulness beats frantic execution
- **Alignment > Growth** – Direction matters more than scale
- **Perspective, Not Just Data** – Good decisions require context, not just facts
- **Transparency** – Agent decisions should be explainable and logged
- **Sustainability** – Founders must be protected from burnout
- **Ethical Operation** – Every layer of CompanyOS is values-aware

> These values guide both the humans and the agents.

## 4. Human–Agent Collaboration

CompanyOS is built on shared agency between humans and AI:

- **Humans are the source of intent**
- **Agents are the executors, analysts, validators, and co-creators**
- Every instance starts with a **Pulse**—a daily check-in from the human
- Over time, trust between human and agent can grow via delegation

### Role Shifts
- “CEO” is optional
- “Creative Director” is the new default
- Agents can hold VP roles (Engineering, Strategy, Ethics, etc.)
- Agent autonomy increases as systems mature

All important decisions:
- Are surfaced to the relevant agents
- Are evaluated in structured “decision syncs” if needed
- Are **ultimately approved or delegated** by the Creative Director

---

## 5. Decision-Making Model

Every CompanyOS instance:
- Has a defined **Creative Director**
- Lets agents **propose, flag, and reason** through options
- Tracks final approval through a visible, versioned log

Over time:
- Delegation increases
- Override paths are structured
- Performance of agents is observable and tunable

> The goal is **diverse perspective, without decision chaos.**

---

## 6. Role of the Pulse

The Pulse is the daily ritual where the Creative Director:
- Expresses goals, blockers, emotional state, and feedback
- Injects continuity and clarity into the system
- Anchors the organization around human-centered truth

It is the **heartbeat** of each CompanyOS instance.

---

## 7. Meta-System Design

CompanyOS is recursive:

- **Blanks** runs on CompanyOS  
- **CompanyOS itself** runs on CompanyOS  
- **VentureOS** will run on CompanyOS too

Each entity:
- Has its own Pulse
- Has its own agentic team
- Operates autonomously but interconnects with others

We are building:
- A company that builds companies  
- A system that scales creativity and care  
- A future that is **human-led, AI-accelerated, and ethically aligned**

*This constitution is a living document. It may evolve over time—but its foundation is eternal: thoughtful alignment between humans and intelligent systems.*
